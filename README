Zend Db Model Adapter
=============================

This mini project is a good start for every ZF 1.11+ (not ready for ZF 2.0) developer to create base model entities from defined tables so you don't need to waste Your time writing getters and setters for each table.

How it works
-------------------------------------------

Place this project repository as a GIT or SVN submodule in your project's repository, say ~/project_root/model-generator. Edit config.ini to fit your needs. Mostly you will need to change only docblock and table entries. The script will read
your application.ini file and will try to use default db adapter and it's parameters of [development : production] section.

Once your config.ini is configured, you can run model-generator.php in CLI mode.
I.e.: php model-generator/model-generator.php

More about table.<something> entries
-------------------------------------------

It's pretty self explanatory. You have to manually register each database table from which model entity and mapper will be created.

The structure:
table.profiles = users
          ^        ^
          |        |
     your table  module where the model will be created

If you leave the module value empty for the specific table then the model will be placed under application/models.

As I wasn't very happy with the structure of his model structure eventually I decided to create my own to fit my needs. If you will have any questions, ideas etc, you are welcome to contact me :)

Hope I will help with this project someone else :)
